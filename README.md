# Tic tac toe (client side)
This project is a client application for playing Tic tac toe on the Android platform.

## Description
This application implements a gaming interface for playing Tic tac toe on Android devices. Users can play this classic game against each other.

## Technologies

## !Important
First you need to start the server, and then run the Android application on an emulator.

## Server side
Start the server using the following instructions.
https://github.com/riggelllll/Tic-tac-toe-server-side

## Installation and launch
1. Clone the repository using the command:
git clone https://github.com/riggelllll/Tic-tac-toe-client-side.git
<br><b>OR</b> if you use Android Studio , then click on the <b>Get from VCS</b> button on the main screen and paste the URL there.
2. Open the project in Android Studio and run it on your device or emulator.

## Phone or emulator
The code is written to run the application on an emulator. Here I use IP address 10.0.2.2 used in the Android emulator to access the host machine on which the emulator is running. 
<br><b>Please note</b> that this IP address only works inside the Android emulator. On a real device, you must use the real IP address of your host machine on your local network to access the same server.
